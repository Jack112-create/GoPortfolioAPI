# Go Portfolio API

## Overview

<p>Go Portfolio API is a personal project, created to provide details about my github profile and repositories.</p>

## Technology
  - Go programming language
  - Go Fiber Framework

<p>I decided to use <strong>Go</strong> to build the api, since it was a new piece of technology that I had been learning and I wanted to put the knowledge and skills into practice. <strong>Go Fiber</strong> was not chosen for any particular reason, but it was quick and easy to get basic routing in place allowing me to focus more on what I wanted this application to do.</p>
